# boost-asio-examples
Repository containing various small examples I've written while learning [Boost.Asio](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_75_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html).

## Building
Run the following commands at the project root:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cmake --build build
```
The compiled binaries will be in the `build` directory.
